resizing an image larger than the original size requires that new pixels be created. this process is called interpolation or up-rezzing. there are many mathematical ways called algorithms to do this. the most common method used by default by many pixel editing applications is called bicubic interpolation. bicubic along with with its newer variants bicubic smoother and bicubic sharper work by averaging a small group of neighboring pixels to determine the color value of the new pixels to be added. while this technique is fast it does not distinguish edges so there is a uniform loss of sharpness and detail across the image. genuine fractals and bicubic smoother comparison genuine fractals 5 patented algorithms work differently. it starts by analyzing ever-decreasing sizes of pixel blocks in your image looking for repeating natural patterns at different sizes. these are known as fractals. fractals are common naturally repeating patterns found everywhere. for example a river system viewed from space has the same shape as the veins in a leaf. these are both fractal patterns at very different scales. the great thing about fractal patterns is once you find them they can be scaled to any size without loss in detail. this allows genuine fractals 5 to resize your image over 1000% without losing sharpness and edge detail. unmatched image resizing genuine fractals 5 can resize your images over 1000% and still maintain sharp edges and minute details. to give you an idea of how big that is you could take a full-frame image from a six megapixel image and resize it to make a print of 10x15 feet at 180 ppi! it is a must for any photographer or artist who makes large format or poster sized prints. it is also great for journalists sports and wildlife photographers who may need to take a cropped section of an image and still make a high-quality print from it. cropping can leave you with very few pixels to work with. if you where to crop this professional 12 megapixel image to keep just the antelope you would be left with only four megapixels of information barely enough to make a good 5x7 print. however with genuine fractals 5 you could make a print over 6 feet tall. save hard disk space and bandwidth increasing the size and resolution of a file results in a larger file on disk. you can reduce the disk space needed and bandwidth when transferring files by saving your files into the genuine fractals 5 .stn format which provides lossless and visually lossless wavelet compression to cut your file size in half or more. now you can store twice as many images on your hard drive and upload them in half the time. long time users of genuine fractals remember having to save files as a .stn file before being able to scale the image. in genuine fractals 5 any file that is opened in photoshop can be scaled in one easy step without having to save as a .stn file first. batch processing with genuine fractals 5 genuine fractals 5 can be automated easily by using a photoshop action. by default genuine fractals 5 remembers its last used setting--however you can create a photoshop action to resize an entire folder of images at the same time. not just for photographers genuine fractals 5 is not just for photographers but anyone who needs to resize images. graphic designers can end the everyday problem of receiving low resolution images from clients for high resolution print work. genuine fractals 5 can also help you create tradeshow and billboard graphics from average sized images. genuine fractals 5 is also commonly used by service bureaus as well as law enforcement and architects for resizing small files.,onone software,159.95
